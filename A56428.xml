         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Harbour, and ſufficiently ſhelter'd, both from the one and the other. Having adorn'd the Front of this little Work, with the marks of Your <hi>Grandeur:</hi> For though You are no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, You do partake in a high degree the Sacred Lineaments of one. The Antiquity as well as the Nobility of Your Illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which has Enrich'd all Hiſtories with the Renown'd Feats of Your Anceſtors, (the Rank wherein Your Birth, and Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has plac'd You to be the Beſt of Kings, a Model of Piety for all Princes, the Virtuous and War-like <hi>Caeſar</hi> of the moſt Flouriſhing Kingdoms of the World) are to Me a ſufficient Argument of Your Participated Divinity: Who then ſhall be able to violate the Rights of Your Protection? Or where could I with more aſſurance withdraw to ſhelter my Self from the Enemies of Innocency, than under the ſhadow of ſo Great a Monarch, at whoſe Feet we have ſeen all the Venomous Darts of Envy, Ill-wiſhes and Malice, that Your Private and Publick Enemies could let fly at You, drop down, to their own Confuſion, and the greater Luſtre of Your Glory: So that the World may learn hereafter, (by the tender Care which the Heavens have, and always had of Your Sacred Perſon) how vain it is to ſtrive againſt Him, whom the Powerful Hand of God does Protect.</p>
            <p>There is nothing of a Prodigy that appears to our Eyes, but hath its Effects ſoon or late,
<pb facs="tcp:29563:3"/>
good or evil: The Prodigies which appear'd in the Skies over the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were the fore-runners of the general Deſtruction of that unfortunate place: The Blazing-Star which appear'd to the three <hi>Weſtern</hi> Kings, brought the Happy News of a New-born <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> to thoſe poor <hi>Pagans</hi> who liv'd in the Darkneſs of Idolatry for ſo many years: And this which appear'd of late days, did (as we may reaſonably conclude) Prognoſticate the Gracious and Happy end of <hi>Charles</hi> II. Your dearly beloved Brother, as alſo Your Lawful and Peaceable Poſſeſſion of the Crown, a main Bleſſing which the Heavens were pleas'd to confer on You for all Your Sufferings, both at Home and Abroad with that unſpeakable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and full Reſignation to God's Decrees.</p>
            <p>Now Your Subjects may rejoyce to ſee themſelves Govern'd by a King whom God has Adorn'd with all neceſſary Prerogatives to compleat a Monarch: The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> (if now living) might ſet forth with all her Attendance, and Accompany the reſt of the Princes and Potentates of the World, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate Your Coronation, and admire the Virtuous and Prudent <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of Your Court and Government. Theſe ſhould be ſufficient Motives to bring this little Work before Your Throne, with all Humility to beg the Favour of Your Gracious Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; But that Two other Powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations lays (by Duty) that Obligation
<pb facs="tcp:29563:4"/>
on me to crave it: The one, is, The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſentment which I ſhall harbour in my Heart for ever, (with all them of my Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,) of the Good Will which You have; and always had from Your Infancy for our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, whoſe Foreign or Domeſtick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could never bring You to an underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of their Service, no more than their venomous Reflections to the leaſt miſtruſt of their True and conſtant Affection. Wherefore as nature does Print in the very Subſtance of every particular a ſpecial feeling of what ever Favour is done to the whole Body, I think it a Duty incumbent on me, as being a Member of that Your Loyal and always Well-affected Nation, to reſent and acknowledge Your Kindneſs, and all Your Good Wiſhes for them, by offering up my moſt Humble and Earneſt Addreſſes to the Almighty for Your long Life, and Happy Reign.</p>
            <p>The other, is the ſpecial Kindneſs I receiv'd at Your Hands in <hi>France</hi> by the Mediation of Major <hi>Francis Pluncket,</hi> and Captain <hi>Michael Brett,</hi> both Your Majeſties Loyal Subjects, and Well-beloved Officers; whoſe Love and Care of Me was ſo great, as being their near Relation; that they procur'd me a Letter of Recommendation from Your Majeſty, which prov'd ſo Efficatious, as to get Me into a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge upon Sight, and without any further delay: All the Thunder-bolts of Heaven would be too too little to be pour'd down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:29563:4"/>
me for a juſt Revenge, if I ſhould not make a large Acknowledgment of thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Favours. The offer I make You of theſe firſt Fruits of my Studies, may paſs (I hope) for a ſincere Act of my Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; not that I think my ſelf acquitted of my Debt, (for I do eſteem my ſelf moſt Happy to live in the Impoſſibilities of doing it;) But only to call the Publick as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of my Endeavours; to the end, that my Will (acknowledging the Power which is wanting in Me,) may be freed from all blame on this Subject, wherein I ſhall never ſuffer my ſelf to be made Criminal.</p>
            <p>Accept then moſt Gracious Prince of this Work, which I thought to be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Your Inclinations, ſince You have always endeavour'd to maintain the Glory of God againſt all the ſinful practices of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Age we live in. Moreover, being that the <hi>Converſion of Souls,</hi> (the Hereditary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of all Godly Princes) holds the firſt rank amongſt the Honourable Spoils of our Saviours Victories.</p>

God hears him, and fixing preſently at the feet of his Supplication, Ah be it ſo as you deſire: He doth authorize it with a Prodigy, which did aſtoniſh the whole World. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that, for to aſsure him of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Promiſe; though he had placed the Stars in a firm ſettlement, he rul'd their motions after an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way, commanding the Sun to go back on his ſteps, and to retrograde ten Degrees.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſeeing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe ſtartled and ſeiz'd with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:29563:9"/>
at the novelty of this Prodigy, deputes ſoon after, Embaſſadors, with orders to Congratulate <hi>Ezechias,</hi> that Heaven and Earth did concur to the Happy recovering of his Health. As they were arriv'd, they were Treated Royally; The Prince Honours them with his Preſence every where; gives them a ſight of the Rarities of his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, of the Magnificence of his Court, of the Grandeur of his Riches: Opens the Cabinets where all ſhines with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, and pieces of Remark; conducts them into the Hall of Perfume, and through that of the Veſsels of Price, and omits nothing that might cauſe them to have a high eſteem of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. But at the ſame time as this Prince was making a ſhew of his Power, God pronounces the Sentence of his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: <hi>Iſaia,</hi> declares the contents of it to him: <hi>Hear the word of the Lord,</hi> (ſays he unto him:) <hi>the day ſhall come, that they will plunder your Palace: All the Treaſures that your Anceſtors have left you, ſhall be as a booty to the</hi> Babylonians: <hi>Your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be the Eunuches of their Kings Palace.</hi> Great God! what was the crime of <hi>Ezechias</hi> to deſerve ſuch a puniſhment?

to manifeſt the Glory of his Benefactor, whom he reſolv'd evermore to publiſh over all the Corners of the Earth.

            <p>Your Dearly Beloved Son, how ever, has thaught you heretofore, what we ought to understand by that way of ſpeaking, when that with his own mouth he did eſtabliſh another kind of Maternity compatible with yours.<note place="margin">Quae eſt mater mea &amp; qui ſunt fratres mei &amp; exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens manum in diſcipulos, dixit ecce mater mea, &amp; fratres mei. <hi>Mat. c.</hi>

from any Act; this follows the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of liberty, which, in the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Grace, is near to its effect. Great God, ſays St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is not your Love without meaſure for men? You are not at all of the humour of the Children of the World, who are afraid to have many Brothers Co-heirs, that they alone might ſucceed without any Aſſociates to the Inheritance of their Parents. You are the only Son of the Father, and yet you do not deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſole Heir of his Subſtance. You call,) without any exception, to the Rights of Heaven and Eternity,) all them, who, undervaluing the Droſs of the World, ſhall believe in your Goſpel.

not, but by that voluntary Oblation to clear off all his ſcores with God: O God of Love, if I give my ſelf alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to you, if I proſtrate my heart at the Feet of your Altars; if I freely Sacrifice all my deſigns to your good will and pleaſure; and if by diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, I do engage to you my Free-will and Liberty, to ſerve you for ever, reſerving only to my ſelf the bare uſe of my Life, and that I do firmly reſolve to paſs over my days in a full ſubmiſſion to your Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; will you not be ſatisfied?

               <p>I do reſpect and honour all the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing thoughts of thoſe Holy and high Spirited men: But let us reduce them all to an Unity; let us find out one Guift, one Payment, one Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which by way of Eminency may be all Guift; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

What is this precious Guift? this plenary Satisfaction? this abſolute Payment? Doubtleſs it is the Son of God, a Son whom the Father hath given us; and in giving him, he gave us all that his Heavenly Court could afford; ſo that if he demands of us that which appertains unto him, and re-calls what he hath given us; let us reſtore him back again his Son, or at leaſt another who may be like him; and this is all that he can expect.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall this be perform'd? If it be true that the <hi>Phyloſopher</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Per quas cauſas quid componi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, per eaſdem diſſolvitur.</note> That by what cauſes a thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, by the ſame it is diſſolv'd: Then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore this Guift to God by the ſame ways we receiv'd it, and by which this precious Guift deſcended down
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29563:22"/>
from Heaven to us. He came forth from the abundant and fruitful memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Father, the Original ſource of the Divine Perſons, he took his way through the Love of the Holy Ghoſt, who cloath'd him with a Robe of mens wearing, and hid him in a Virgins Womb for the ſpace of nine Months: The World hath ſeen him born in a Stable, laid down in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, cry for Hunger, tremble with Cold, and die on a ſhameful Croſs in the ſight of all Nations: There is the Child that God hath given us; but he is not the Child that the Father will have from us, becauſe he has him already ſeated at his Right Hand in his full ſplendour, and in all his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions.</p>
               <p>He aims at another who muſt be like him, and who muſt alſo proceed from his Subſtance, paſs through the love of the Holy Ghoſt, be clad like Chriſt, be born, die, and buried with him, for to riſe up Glorious, and mount Triumphing up to Heaven. This is a ſecond Child form'd by the model of the firſt, and Him we muſt offer up to the Eternal Father, for to clear off our Debts; Here you have the Myſtery of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:29563:22"/>'Tis true, that the Son of God has found out a way for us to pay off our debts, 'tis the value and merits of his dying life; but this price muſt be put into our hands; He is upon his journey to Heaven; what does he do? for to leave us the handling of his Treaſures, he ſends us his holy Ghoſt to whom he leaves his precious Blood together with all his merits, as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Seed, wherein, by the force of his Love, he concurs to the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not of the Son of God, but of a Son altogether like the Son of God; to the end that this Son, (ſo like unto the Son of God, conceived in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Seed of Jeſus, after the model of the word <hi>Incarnate,</hi> by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt,) may paſs before God for an equivalent ſatisfaction and payment of all our Debts.</p>
               <p>This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note> Pledge of the Holy Ghoſt, which he reſerves to give to men, when that endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to purchaſe Heaven, they ſhall be demanded, whether they have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent payment for its Acquiſition. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is of a contrary Opinion, for he will not have this payment to be called a Pledge, but an Oblation to God: Becauſe, that when the thing is reſtor'd for which the Pledge was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29563:23"/>
laid out,<note place="margin">Pignus cum redditua res ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa aufertur, arrha autem de ipſa reddatur quae dando pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur, ut res quando reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur impleatur quod datum eſt non mutetur. <hi>D. Aug. ſer. 15. de verb. dom. ſtatim initio.</hi>
                  </note> the Pledge of courſe muſt be taken up; and ſo God in giving us Heaven, which is the purchaſe we aim at, the Holy Ghoſt muſt take away his Pledge, which is his Grace; and that cannot be; for it's not the ſame with Grace, as it is with Faith; for Grace ought to ſubſiſt with Glory, but Faith not; ſo that this payment which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Pledge, rigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taken, muſt be no Pledge, but rather an Oblation to God, which is a part of the thing we would fain buy, and which cannot be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way when the Contract is complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And in effect Grace is the ſource and firſt beginning of Salvation, which ends in Glory, and hath its full conſummation in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Let us then give God this Gracious Child, the ſecond work of the Holy Ghoſt:<note place="margin">Aſpicis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum hominem &amp; Deum, ſed oſtendit tibi Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hominem &amp; ſervat tibi De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>D.

                  </note> But we muſt give him to God in the ſame ſhape and Form, as he gave Us his own Son, reſerving him Glorious with himſelf, and ſuffering amongſt us: He did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cheriſh him within his Sacred boſom, as him whom he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender from all Eternity, Co-equal, Conſubſtantial, and of one and the ſame Nature: But from himſelf, he deals with him as with a Criminal,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29563:23"/>
and the chiefeſt of all Malefactors, you would ſay that he doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for his Son. The ſame way we muſt offer and treat this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, glorious and paſſible: Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Cabinet of our Souls, but paſſible in the exteriour of our Bodies: Within we muſt conſider him as the object of our moſt tender Affections, give him a Princely attendance, and Adore him without any diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Theſe, and many more ſuch Actions have daz'led your eyes, and forc'd your mouth to confeſs ingeniouſly, that they muſt be the works of Divine Power.

                  </note> but the ſame which our Saviour gave to <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> Verily I tell you, that whoever is not regenerated by water, and the Holy Ghoſt, cannot be ſav'd: For even as being dead by Original ſin, you are regenerated by the water of Baptiſm; ſo being dead by your Actual ſins, you are re-call'd to life by the water of your bitter Tears in the Sacrament of Pennance.

hearts by a new conception of Love, which I call, <hi>The ſecond Nativity of Jeſus,</hi> which takes its Being, and all its Value from the Firſt.</p>
               <p>The Relations of the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are admirable; For, as the firſt Nativity of Jeſus in the Sacred womb of the Virgin, was by the Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union of the Divine Perſon with Humane Nature, to appropriate to himſelf all her Actions. So the ſecond Nativity of Jeſus in a Soul is accompliſh'd by the intimate Union of his Preſence, by which he becomes the moſt happy ſource and off-ſpring of all her Actions, and renders them meritorious of Heaven. And as Jeſus, in as much as he was man alone, could not operate that great work of our Redemption;<note place="margin">Si tamen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patimur ut &amp; conglorificemur <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> v. <hi>17.</hi> Si commortui ſumus &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivemus, ſi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinebimus &amp; conregnabimus. <hi>2 Tim.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi> ver. <hi>12.</hi> Si enim com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantati ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> if by the means of that Union, he had not acquir'd the Power and Dignity of it: Even ſo it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, without that ſecond Nativity of the Son of God in us, to do any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Action that might deſerve Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. To ſay, that it is to injure and intrench upon the Rights and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the firſt Nativity, to refer the conſummation of particular Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the neceſſity of a ſecond Nativity, it is to deſtroy the Eſſential Subordination of thoſe two terms,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29563:26"/>
ſuffer and ſuffer with, ſo often Preach'd by the Apoſtle, and to have that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick only laid on a ſick mans Table ſhould do him good without taking it. In the Paſſion of the Son of God, we have a moſt powerful remedy for all our diſtempers, but its effect in us depends on the compaſſion, as a condition, without which, nothing turns to our advantage.</p>
               <p>The Spirit is not as yet fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the ſecrets contain'd in this ſecond Nativity; And therefore I muſt explain more at large the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order obſerv'd in it: And of what nature is that Union of the Soul with Grace, which brings God to be preſent with Man by a ſtricter tye, than that of the Subſtantial Form, which gives him Life: For it's not an Union like that which brings the <hi>Sun</hi> to be preſent to the very bowels of the <hi>Earth,</hi> by the emiſſion of his Influences, to produce therein all ſorts of Mettals. Neither is it an union of Authority and Pre-eminency, as that of a King or Monarch, who is not preſent in all the Provinces of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, but by the Officers of his Crown. No, for all thoſe preſences, to ſpeak properly, not being perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, cannot produce ſuch Holy and

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> That this Sorrowful Delivery is the Accompliſhment of the Word-Incarnate.</head>
               <p>ACcompliſhment is a term, and a way of ſpeaking much us'd by <hi>Phyloſophers</hi> to expreſs the laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of each Nature, either in the conſtitution of her bare Being, or in the further flouriſhing or ornament of her well-Being; And as in the diviſion of Beings there are found four ſorts, Metaphyſical, Phyſical, Moral and Artificial; ſo each has his accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well Eſſential as Accidental: I do not here take the word Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in its rigorous ſignification, for that which can be, and not be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the corruption of its ſubject; but only for all that does not enter into
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29563:41"/>
the preciſe conſtitution of the Eſſence: Let us leave thoſe terms to <hi>Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us come to the point, and ſay that the Incarnation may be reduc'd to many ſtates: Firſt, if we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in the Eternal and Infinite Conceptions of God, not as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the difference of times, then its Eſſential accompliſhment ſhall be Gods Eternal determination of the ſame (<hi>viz.</hi>) That among many other means which he might make choice of for to work the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, he reſolv'd the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his dearly beloved Son, with an obligation of Suffering, which determination puts a ſtop to all other poſſible ways of Redemption to bring it to that of a Suffering and Crucified Love. And in ſo doing, I may reduce the Incarnation to a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical ſtate: But the Phyſical ſtate is that Hypoſtatical Union ever to be Ador'd, which has joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the fulneſs of time thoſe Extremities ſo far aſſunder, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Nature; and which has given us the Divine Child Jeſus and only delights of mankind for to put in Execution that work ſo much importing the Welfare and Happineſs of all Mortals.</p>

               <p>As for the Artificial Incarnation, they are the amorous inventions of the Holy Ghoſt, which bring along with them as many particular diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as they have divers Motives to bring us to good: And as the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's deſign is never to leave off until he compleats the Pourtract according as he conceiv'd it in his mind; even ſo the Holy Ghoſt whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our does promiſe to ſend to his Church, has for the Sacred Object of his imployment; to labour with ſo much Induſtry to the Converſion of ſinners, that he will never give over his undertaking, until he forms in

               <p>IT is no ſufficient acknowledgment of what great Obligations we have to God, to pay him only our bare reſpects, and lay down at his feet the ſlender Tribute of our Homage, for what Graces and Favours we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at his Hands, ſince ever the Planets with their conſtant courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to meaſure out the year into Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the advantage and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man: We muſt dive into the Regiſter-Office of Eternity; there we ſhall find the chief motive of our Thanksgiving, and whereby to make appear to all Creatures, how Noble and antient is the Extraction of Man; being that the firſt thought of his Creation is conceiv'd at once with the generation of the Word, and that the care which God the Father had of Humane Nature was before the Inſtitution and order of times, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Love and knowledge: For
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29563:49"/>
bringing together within the fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of his memory, all intelligible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as well without as within his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, to make them in himſelf the Object of his knowledge, which finds no other reſt or ſettlement but his Eternal Word, he knows them all in the Order and Excellency of their Nature, without the leaſt confuſion of Thoughts. And becauſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all intelligible Creatures, Man has by right the ſecond degree of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to Angels; Man and Angel have been the Object of the Father's Eternal Knowledge, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his Love; For as the knowledge of the poſſible Being of Man enters into the Generation of the Word, ſo his Love meets in the production of his Holy Ghoſt; for all that is Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible verity to his underſtanding, is at the ſame inſtant a lovely Object to his Will.</p>
               <p>This is it that mov'd God in the difference of times to give us four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable proofs of his Eternal Care: The firſt, he brings Man from nothing by Creation: The ſecond, when that Man had forgot his Reſpects to his Creator, he reſolves to repair his loſs, by uniting Humane Nature to the Divine in the Incarnation of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29563:50"/>
his Son: The third, he prepares for him in Heaven an Immortal Crown, in order to enjoy for ever in Glory the ſight of his Divine Eſſence: And the fourth, when that by his Actual Sin he ſhall come to looſe all right to that Glory, by the loſs of preſent Juſtice in this Life, he offers him the means of a Repentance, by the Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he gives him of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>All theſe aforeſaid Actions are the worthy Imployments of his Divinity; but the Converſion of a Sinner, of all ſeems the chiefeſt; as for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was as it were neceſſary, or at leaſt moſt convenient that God ſhould give actual Exiſtence to Man, being that his poſſibility was in his Thoughts from all Eternity; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it might be ſaid That Power was faulty, being not reduc'd to Act: To aſſign him a ſtate of Glory, where after his Pilgrimage he might find his Center and final Settlement; that follows immediately the way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt Principle, who at the ſame inſtant, as he gives Being to a Creature, gives him his Settlement and final reſt. As for the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union in the Incarnation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the deſign was taken in the moſt

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29563:65"/>
The third on the account he gives of all the Labours and Pains he takes in the purſuit of our Souls:<note place="margin">Attolite portas principes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtras &amp; introi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit Rex gloriae, Dominus virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ipſe est Rex gloriae, <hi>Pſal. 23. v. 9.</hi>

They enquire within, what he is; and he anſwers, that He is their Lord, Powerful and Strong, the Lord of all Virtues, the King of all Glory; Whereupon they preſently open'd their Gates, receiv'd him in, and brought him into his Throne with the acclamations of all the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Court.<note place="margin">Vox dilecti mei pulſantis.

that the Soul ſends her Lacquey to the door to tell that Madam is not within, that he that knocks may come another time, or if he has any Packet, to leave it, and it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Madam when ſhe comes from her walk: That Lady is the Soul, the Lacquey is the Body;<note place="margin">Caro concupiſcit adverſus ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ſpiritus autem adverſus carnem. <hi>Gal. 5. v. 17.</hi>
                  </note> for when God calls us to infuſe ſome good Notions into our Souls, the Body is always contrary, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,) to the Spirit, is hard by to make oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: Let us conſider, I pray, the malice of that excuſe. What is the reaſon that a Body gives orders to tell that he is not within when he is call'd for? It is either becauſe he is not dreſt and in a condition to appear; or that the perſon that looks for him is not grateful to him, or that he is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him, and having not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to pay him, he commands his Servants to tell that he is not within. O great God be not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Impudence of that bold Harlot, who gives Orders to tell that ſhe is not within, when you call for her: For in good earneſt ſhe is not within, ſhe is far from you; her Sins have carried her away to ſome Foreign Region, as far off as another Prodigal Child; and though ſhe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29563:69"/>
had been within, ſhe wants the Robe of Charity; ſhe is in no condition to appear: Her Face is made black with the Cole of her Crimes, your ſight would make her horrible; moreover, your company is nothing acceptable to her;<note place="margin">Quae enim par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatio juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae cum iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Cor. 6. v. 14.</hi>

                  </note> Let it be ſo as you will have it, that ſhe is far from her God. Is it not God that gathers together the ſcattered Sheep, and leaves Ninety Nine in Heaven to look for one that is loſt on Earth? If ſhe be naked and without the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Charity, is it not Jeſus that cloaths them without any other coſt, charge or trouble, only to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive them? But ſhe has not wherewithal to make ſatisfaction, let her not trouble her mind with any; and if ſhe had, ſhe cannot of her ſelf merit the leaſt degree of Grace in the rigour of Juſtice, whilſt ſhe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of ſin: It is enough
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29563:69"/>
that the precious Blood of Jeſus is of an Infinite value to make all thoſe excuſes frivolous, and never to be admitted of.</p>
               <p>The third invention of Love that Jeſus imploys in our ſearch, is to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eys the labours he undergoes upon this account; as a loving Father to his Children, though debauch'd out of all meaſure: after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and authority of a Father could not prevail with them, no more than his ſweet alluring words, and his threatnings; he comes at laſt with a ſad countenance, the tears in his eyes, and fetches a languiſhing ſigh from the bottom of his Heart.

At the age that I am in, I ſhould by courſe take my reſt; Yet it is Then that I ſee my ſelf engaged in a thouſand trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and all this upon your account: I deprive my ſelf of all contentments for to advance your Fortune: I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my life to many hazards for to preſerve yours; if you have not the good nature to requite my affections, at leaſt have compaſſion of my Labour and Toyl.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29563:70"/>
ſtoops down, takes off his Hat, draws nearer for fear that he ſhould not hear the voice of them from whom he expects his anſwer;<note place="margin">En ipſe ſtat poſt parietem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum reſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>&amp;c.

                  </note> So that in the ardent deſire he has to hear and ſee what is doing within doors, he willingly ſuffers all foul weathers: The Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of the ſame Compariſon: Lo! here he is, (ſays he, ſpeaking of the Spouſe,) hidden behind the wall, who looks in through the openings and chincks of the door; for he is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know what we do, and whether we hear his voice or no, that he ſpares not to ſtoop down and look in through thoſe overtures with a great deal of attention, for fear that our anſwers ſhould be ſo weak, that he could not over-hear them.</p>
               <p>Have we ſpoke the good word? have we produced an act of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life?

                  </note> diſcourſing at large of the effects of Gods good will for us, gives us the ſame diſtinction in divers Expreſſions; In one place, he ſays, That God has two means which he makes uſe of to Convert a Sinner and work his Salvation; the one is Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its Effect, Infallible in its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and this he imploys for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate Souls; The other is that which he gave to thoſe that he did invite to the Nuptials, but took their Excuſes and would not come: The former is call'd Efficacious according to Gods purpoſe; This, ſufficient, in the deſign that he has to deſtroy no body. That is ſo infallible in its effect, that whoſoever receives it, St. <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:29563:80"/>
aſſures him,<note place="margin">John. 16.</note> That Hell with all its forces ſhall never be able to take him out of Gods Hands. This, is an effect of the Divine Goodneſs, but ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the malice of our corrupt Will, which does not concur with that Off-ſpring of all her Happineſs: That, is never found ſeperated from the practice of Good, or the exerciſe of Virtue; This is only a bare faculty, which gives of it ſelf the Power to hope for Goodneſs, if we pleaſe; but moſt commonly we keep it a Slave and a Priſoner under the Irons of Blood and Fleſh, as the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. v. 4.</note> The benignity of God has called you to Repentance; but the hardneſs of your Soul, and your obſtinate Heart has increaſ'd Gods Indignation and wrath which ſhall come thundring on your Heads at the day of Judgement.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction makes out, that the word, <hi>Sufficient,</hi> muſt not be taken as the <hi>Grammarians</hi> do; that is, as if this only means had been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Soul to the final point of her Converſion: No, it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the ſtile of <hi>Theology,</hi> for a means ſufficient to Salvation, if it be naanag'd as it ought to be. So we ſay in the moſt Sacred Myſtery of the Incarnation, that our Saviour did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:29563:81"/>
operate the Salvation of all men; yet notwithſtanding all that ſufficiency, Mortals-will fall into the large and common rode of Perdition, if they do not really and efficaciouſly apply the paſſion of Chriſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; by reſenting his Sadneſs, his Grief, and his Pains, and joyn this application to that ſufficiency, as a condition, without which, nothing can be done to our advantage.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that among the ſufficient means to Converſion; ſome are Interiour, others Exteriour; the Interiour means is no other than a Godly Thought, which by Gods aſſiſtance gives light to the underſtanding to ſee the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deplorable ſtate of the Soul, and makes the poor ſinner to give a mournful glance towards Heaven, his Native ſoyl, and place of reſt; or otherwiſe an affection or deſire in the will to withdraw the Heart from all Terreſtrial Laws, to aim only and earneſtly at his Soveraign good, which is God.

The one and the other are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provided for by their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of means to come to a Fortune; And it's to no purpoſe to ſay, that there is a great deal of inequality in the caſe, being the one is brought ſo near the Throne of Fortune, that he may touch it in a manner with his Finger; and the other is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to come to it in time, but only with more toyl.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29563:87"/>
our <hi>Roman</hi> profeſſion, and with no other: The firſt of all, is, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of its Exiſtence, before that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> (the Author and firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner thereof,) gave it a vent in the Evangelical Law; So the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Sybils,</hi> the <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Phyloſophers,</hi> though of a contrary opinion in other matters, yet to ſet forth the properties of our Religion, they are all of one mind, and of one opinion. Secondly, the Merits of its Inſtitutor, who is no common man as others, but both God and Man, Irreprehenſible in his Life, Impeccable by Nature, good to all People, and who doth authorize his Doctrine, both by the rare Examples of his Holy Life, and by the Greatneſs of his Miracles; as the very <hi>Mahomet</hi> does openly confeſs in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Integrity of the things Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taught in this Religion, all which come to two points, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the Profit of Man. Fourthly, The general Victories over Idolatry, the baniſhment of Devils, and ſilence of Oracles: For in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>'s time, and at the firſt coming of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Oracles are conſulted, but have not a word to Anſwer, <hi>Porphire, Juvenal, Lucian, Celſus</hi> and the reſt, are altogether aſtoniſh'd at their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29563:87"/>
not underſtanding that it is the true Religion, which begins to make it ſelf known to the World. Fifthly, Its general publication over all the World without any earthly aſſiſtance, favour or ſupport, without Pleaſure, Profit, or any Temporal ſatisfaction, in Patience, Humility and Affliction; In fine, the Infallible Aſſiſtance of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to them of that Profeſſion, as well by the uſe of Holy Sacraments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he confers his Graces on us, as by the care he has to give us his <hi>Angels</hi> to guard and protect us: his <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to comfort us, and his Promiſe aſſuring us of Eternal Life: Let the Heretick then as well as the bad Chriſtian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that it is not God, but the bad uſe they make of their own free will and liberty, that is the cauſe of their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Misfortune and woe.</p>
               <p>But alas! what ſhall we ſay of thoſe poor little Creatures, which in their Mothers womb, (or ſoon after they breath'd the common air of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,) are depriv'd of Life, before they become Peaceable poſſeſſors of the ſame, paſſes from one Priſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and (not having along with them the ſafe conduct of Baptiſm) are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to come within the gates of Heaven.

ſo far from us, as that of <hi>Adam</hi> is, be the cauſe of our daily misfortunes: Original ſin, what a ſubtile poiſon your Infection is? being that it is impoſſible for any Creature (except <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> He by Nature, ſhe by a ſpecial Priviledge) to avoid its fatal ſtain. Were it not far better to deprive thoſe poor Babes of Life for good and all, by leaving them block'd up within that Chaos of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, than to bring them to a ſtate where they ſhall have cauſe to lament for ever their misfortune, without any to comfort them or condole their bad luck. St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> Your Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are able to break any Heart to pieces, when you ſay that very many Children receive not the Grace of God, becauſe they die without Baptiſm, though they have no will contrary to the will and Holy Laws of God; and though the Parents and Prieſts make as much haſt as they can to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Holy Sacrament unto them; thing worthy of compaſſion, they run in all haſte to look for a Remedy to the Evil, and the Patient expires before its application, God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſo to fall out.

               <p>The reaſon is, that as the Children are not guilty before God, but by the fault of their firſt Parent, and never contributed on their ſide to any actul malice, that is in them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a flowing of an Hereditary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29563:89"/>
which ſticks to all them that come to the World, by the way of ordinary Generation, ſo they have not the ſufficient means to ſtop this Original diſorder, but what depends on the Will of another: Now we muſt ſuppoſe that it is morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that the Parents have an actual deſire to confer on their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren this neceſſary means to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is what the Divines call the ſufficient means of little Infants. But if it happens by hazard, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the Child dies in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, or ſoon after, this can be no reaſon to dreſs up a complaint againſt God, becauſe that thoſe ſad Miſchances, arriving through Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes, make that God, who in the general diſpoſition of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe acts as firſt Principle, ſuffers alſo all things to go according to the courſe of their Nature, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any formal deſign notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding againſt that Child; or this in particular, that he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of Sufficient means to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Would you have that God to hinder an Eclipſe of the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſhould diſturb and deſtroy all the order of Nature:<note place="margin">Sicut per unius delictum in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes homines.</note> The Apoſtle ſays, that the Sin of one man had ſo infected all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

                  </note> God will never deny her the continuation of his Graces, until that her Converſion be fully compleated: But becauſe that the ſufficient Grace whereof we ſpoke heretofore, is a general term that comprehends all the particular Graces which precedes the Juſtification, as Diſpoſitions requiſite to the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that Noble form. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that the firſt Thought that falls into a Reaſonable mans Heart, whatever ſtate he is in, is a great deſire to be Sav'd; A deſire which the Divines call a <hi>Velleity</hi> of Salvation, to which God concurs with his ſpecial aſſiſtance, to make this weak deſire come to a perfect will.</p>
               <p>For to comprehend the merit of that Grace,<note place="margin">Quae ſurſum ſunt ſapite non quae ſuper ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram. <hi>Coloſſ. 3. v. 2.</hi>
                  </note> it ſhould be neceſſary to remark with St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and other Saints, that all Spiritual Gifts, all Graces and Favours, which God of his Infinite Mercy communicates to our Hearts, have no other end or aim but to ſtir up our Wills to Actions conducing to Salvation: Which to perform after a ſweet way, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues the Soul with two attractive Powers, he fixes one to the objects of our Converſion, and the other to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:29563:92"/>
its beginning and ground: He orders that the Object ſhall lance a thouſand Luſtres of Beauty towards the poor Sinners Soul,<note place="margin">Quae oculus non vidit, &amp;c. <hi>1 Cor. 2.9.</hi>
                  </note> and ſo many bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Beams whereby Heaven is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him as a place of Reſt, where all Tears, all Labours, all Croſſes and Sufferings are Divinely changed into ſo many Splendours and Lights of Glory; where Saints are Sweetly reduc'd, and Happily ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to Love, freed of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and repleniſh'd with that Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pleaſure, which takes its ſource from the Divine Eſſence.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Charms which the Object pours down into our Hearts; and to the end that its raviſhing Beauties ſhould the ſooner come to lodge therein, God ſhapes them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into ſo many Figures, which he knows will draw our Affections to them, or at leaſt reforms the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Species</hi> we had of them, by giving them a more lively colour.</p>
               <p>His Charms are altogether as great for the Underſtanding and Will, the concurring Principles of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but Principles ſo corrupted ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo diſorder'd in their Inclinations, that, beſides the difficulties they meet with in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:29563:92"/>
practice of Virtues; they are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded that all good and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reſides where Vice even ſits in its Thone with Authority: But God, to bring them from that errour, takes off all contradictions, makes all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties plain, drives away all dark Clouds, clears the underſtanding, and helps on the Will in the purſuit of things which ſhe thought impoſſible, whilſt ſhe was plunged in the dirt of ſin, and lead by the inclinations of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature; then ſhe finds that there is more ſatisfaction and pleaſure to die on the Croſs, than ſhe had of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to live in the fleſh, and is very well pleaſed to gather Roſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Buſhes and Thorns.</p>
               <p>However, let us not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the faculties of the Soul, (to work her Converſion,) requires only the intimate preſence of God, without any further concurrence of any created Principle. I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that God has the power of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential dependency over all Creatures, which makes them always be in a readineſs to obey his Orders beyond their Natural Principles, and the Precincts of their Activity: In that Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis enough that he raiſes up their power proportionably to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:29563:93"/>
miraculous effect that he aims to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. For ſuch miraculous effects tend not to the profit or contentment of the things elevated, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incapable of any ſuch, but only aims to make known the power of the Supream Agent, who makes uſe of them; So that for to Act, they need no other created Principle. But as for Man, it is not the ſame with him;<note place="margin">Poſtquam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſti me egi poenitentiam. <hi>Jerem. cap. 31. v. 16.</hi>
                  </note> for God ſetting him on in the work of his Converſion, will have him to concur really, and as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Principle, even as he did in his averſion from him, when that he committed Sin, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him, unleſs it be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, God beſtows on him a Divine quality, which leaves him in a free power to work the accompliſhment of his Salvation, which he is not able to perform by the bare and ſole Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature: Moreover, had not Man received any other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary quality,<note place="margin">Liberum arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium est cauſa ſui motus, quia homo per libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum arbitrium movet ſe ad agendum. <hi>D. Tho. 1. p q. 83. art, 1. ad 3.</hi>
                  </note> to raiſe up his will to ſupernatural Actions; as all thoſe are that tend directly to Salvation; It might be ſaid that he is a principle meerly paſſive in the practice of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which is contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Belief: Alſo God never ſupplies by himſelf the defect of any ſecond
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29563:93"/>
Cauſes, when it can be done by any other way: The Example of the Bleſſed in Heaven, will make this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity eaſie to be underſtood. It is not enough for a Soul that has for her happy reſidence everlaſting Glory, that God diſcovers unto her the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his Divine Eſſence, and makes his Glorious Beams to ſhine all about her; her Underſtanding muſt alſo march under the conduct of a Light of Glory, to enjoy its Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that muſt be the reſplendent Garment, without which, it durſt not appear.</p>
               <p>It muſt then follow, that the Soul receives ſome Grace from Heaven,<note place="margin">Venit adoravit. eum dicens, Domine Adjuva me. <hi>Matt. 5. v. 15.</hi>
                  </note> which God drops down from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of his moſt tender Love, and not to make her bear in her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the knowledge of all the Divine Beauties, for that is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Office of the exciting Grace; But to help her Will, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to make her the neceſſary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of her Converſion, as all the Fathers of the Sacred Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> do teach; The Holy Church owns the neceſſity of that Grace,<note place="margin">Trident. ſeſſ. 6.

                  </note> by which ſhe deſires the Divine bounty to prevent in ſuch ſort the beginning of our Actions by the ſweetneſs of his aſpirations; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he forſakes us not in the progreſs; to the end that all we do or think, may tend to his Glory, as the Rays to their Sun, the Lines to their Center.</p>

What ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Houſe and Family, being that I have loſt my Wife, my Adviſer, my Helper, my Houſe-keeper, and prudent Oeconomer, who eas'd me of all my cares? Could I but releaſe her life with the effuſion of my Blood, I would ſoon empty all my Veins, to bring her to life again.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:29563:116"/>
for our Friends: But to ſpeak like a Chriſtian, God demands other gueſs thoughts of you in thoſe Afflictions; he pardons thoſe tears that paſs in a moment; But he does expect a grief that ſhall have no other term than Eternity. The Virgins of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeeing our Saviour to towards the Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> covered with blood, and all battered with blows, wept bitterly: He does not approve of their Grief, but tells them freely, that their tears had been better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for themſelves. I ſay the ſame to thoſe Souls; we ought rather to weep for the loſs we have often had of our true Spouſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when that by our infidelities we loſt his preſence; Tears on this only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are grateful to God, and well received by his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when they do produce in us a true Grief of our paſt idle life, and a conſtant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of amendment for the future.</p>

of his Conſolations, and that he will convert himſelf to him, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his Arms to comfort him, in all his Afflictions and Heavineſs of Heart.</p>
               <p>It is then very true, that he who has found out the ſecret of living con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, has concluded, out of the weakneſs of Creatures, and by their inability to furniſh any true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that God alone is He who can really comfort him; a conſequence which is very eaſie to be deduced, if we will but ſuppoſe a Principle known of it ſelf to be true, by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon; which is, that all Men in general, without exception of any whatever, deſires to be content, and live happy: This good luck is never found but in the purſuit, or in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of our laſt end, after which there is no more to be deſired. But it is moſt evident, by the ordinary unquietneſs of our mind, which is never here at reſt through the unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Souls, always at the chaſe of new affections, by reaſon of the diſordered Appetite of all our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are never ſatisfied with the Metaphorical food of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; That the Creature cannot be our laſt end, ſeeing it cannot afford
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:29563:168"/>
us ſo much good at once, as that we may never deſire any more. God alone then remains for our laſt end; for he only can give ſuch content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo perfect, that after it we cannot deſire any more; And therefore no Conſolation can be true, if it has not the full enjoyment of its laſt end.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there is a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the Deſire, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the thing deſired, and that this true Conſolation which all Men look for, is as the <hi>Golden-Fleece</hi> of Antiquity, that could not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away without danger of life, and that we muſt not expect that this Inheritance, which is ours by right, (conteſted nevertheleſs by ſo many Cheats,) muſt not coſt us thouſands of ſtrifes, heavineſs and ſadneſs: There is the time that God waits for, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us: 'tis the hour appointed by <hi>Jeſus</hi> to come and maintain our cauſe, fortifie our Hopes, and give a ſure ground to all our ſteps. For my part, I hold for Moral Hereſie the Doctrine of ſome new-found Spirituals, who Preach for a point of high perfection, to live in <hi>Croſses</hi> without any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that it is proper Love to ſeek for any Pleaſures in Torments: This

this life;</hi> I can find therein no other proportion, but that which might be put betwixt a Moment and Eternity: So when they do plant a ſweet Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, what is it but a thorny ſtump, without either Grace or Beauty? but the Belief they have to ſee fine flowers grow ſome day among thoſe thorns, makes them to cheriſh the ſtem with all its deformity and ſharp points.

For my part, I remit the off-ſpring of thoſe diſorders to the want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Immortality of Souls; For wherever that pernicious errour has crept (that all dyes with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) they may attempt on the Sacred Perſons of Kings, and without any reſpect to the Divinity (whereof they are the lively Images on Earth,) treat them unworthily, ſo be that their dealings be underboard; For if all dyes with the Body, and that there is no account to be taken of their crimes after death; If they do betray the State, if they do ſell their Country, if they do commit the moſt horrid crimes that ever were heard of; they may fear no puniſhment, if that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy belief takes place in their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; Let the great ones oppreſs the little ones, let the rich cut the poor

It's a folly like that of a Merchant, who Freights a Veſſel to go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> to <hi>Peron,</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> to enrich himſelf: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived where the Mines of Gold and Silver are, he ſpends his time in looking at the Hills that are about the place, the Streams that are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, the Woods that are hard by, and does not think of loading his Ship, nor of returning back to his Country. God has placed our Souls in our Bodies, as in a Myſtical Veſſel, it's to load us with the Goods of Eternity, and the Merchandize of Heaven: One ſpends his time with pampering of his Fleſh, another to build a Fortune in the Air; This
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29563:179"/>
Man Fights with the Winds, that Man Paints on the Waters, and none thinks that his Soul is Immortal, nor that ſhe is to return to her Country ſome day; was there ever the like folly?</p>

               <p>This is the Receipt which <hi>Jeſus</hi> preſcribes to all thoſe who are willing to convert themſelves. I will make bold to borrow the words of <hi>Seneca</hi> the Moral <hi>Phyloſopher,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca, Ep. 102</note> to make the Induction thereby. If the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Body trouble your Health, and that by redoubling their rigours, they bring you to Death's door, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:29563:180"/>
as the Priſoner at the firſt news of his Liberty; For Death is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than an enlargement of the Soul out of the Priſon of the Body; where ſhe ſighs under the Irons and Chains of corrupt Nature: If any ask you the queſtion, which is your Countrey, and your Native place? do not ſay that it is <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> or <hi>Smyrna;</hi> No, tell boldly that it is Heaven, being there is nothing here on Earth can content your heart, nor ſet a ſtop to your expectations, for all rouls under the unavoidable Laws of Mortality; Conſider, that even as the Mother which carried you in her Womb, was not reſolved to lodge you there ſtill, but, that after nine months ſpace you ſhould come weeping into the World; So the World that has harboured you for a time had no deſign to give you a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual reſidence, but only to ſuffer you to refreſh your ſelf, as a paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without any tie to the place where you have lodged by way of civility only, and as a Paſſenger, not as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor. This vale of Miſery is but an Inne, the Riches are but Honours and Vanity, the Pleaſures are the Houſhold-ſtuff; Man is the Pilgrim and Traveller, he is not permitted to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:29563:180"/>
carry any thing along with him, he muſt firſt account with his Hoſt, and after march off from whence he came; and as he has nothing here but the bare uſe of things, as all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nothing remains to him but the Immortal thoughts of Heaven to maintain himſelf in the advantage of his pretentions.</p>
               <p>Let us then aim at Heaven, our Native Soil, if we be not willing to be placed among the number of Bruit Beaſts, and to the great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of the wiſe conduct of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who by the thoughts of Immortality deſires to wean our affections from the Earth, and bring them to purchaſe an Immortal Glory.</p>

                  <hi>Jeſus</hi> is our Monarch, we are his Subjects. Before the Creation what were we? A no Being, a meet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, a pure nothing. <hi>Adam</hi> is no ſooner come out of the Matrice of that <hi>Chaos,</hi> but God puts him in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Heaven and Earth, expreſly commanding all Nature to obey his Orders, he commands his Angels to caſt a Line, and mark out the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of a Royal Houſe, of a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Pallace, of a Terreſtrial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice: All being ſet in good Order, they bring him into that Inheritance, he was not there full three hours, when that by an Act of Fellony he becomes refractory to his <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> and by a manifeſt Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion he undervalues the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Sovereign, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Appetite of a moſt vile concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence: All Creatures would have been revenged of ſo great a diſorder, and the very inſenſible themſelves drawing up his Proceſs, would have puniſhed him in the very place; but
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:29563:182"/>
that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of Heaven, the Son and Heir of the Eternal Father, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to accommodate that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, makes himſelf to be put into his place, takes from Humane Nature by Incarnation whereby to repair that diſorder, and make full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Parties offended in rigour of Juſtice through the Infinite Merit of his Proctorſhip: The Criminal is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his Rights which he loſt through his diſobedience; all the pieces of his Proceſs are brought out of the Eternal Fathers <hi>Regiſter-Office,</hi> and nailed on the <hi>Croſs</hi> never to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced any more againſt the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors; does not this ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's Love for Men.</p>
               <p>Love goes on always, increaſing as the Morning-ſtar, and even as the fire never ſtops the courſe of its activity, until that all combuſtible matters which entertains its action be taken away: So the Divine love never gives over to ſpread its flames, whilſt it finds objects capable of its Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And in caſe he finds none, he creates ſome; For man the ſecond time becoming inſolent, and being ſurpriſed in Rebellion, his Arms in his hands, that is, committing of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin, was reſolved to nail once more

Jeſus his Redeemer on the Croſs, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells me: Action, which ought to ſet a ſtop to the courſe of his love, but that he puts a mask on his eyes, and ſeems not to take notice of our inſolencies, he appoints his Prieſts to be Commiſſaries to examine and judge the Delinquents, but with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not to deal rigorouſly with them, nor according to all the points of Law; and that he will never fail to confirm the graces of Abſolution which his Judges ſhall give, ſo be that they do atteſt the repentance of the penitent; Nay, and which is more, he is reſolved to give them Letters of Nobility, and make them Knights of the Order of the Holy Ghoſt, if they do but leave off their baſe trading with Creatures, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves in the noble actions of Heaven and Salvation.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favours will be an object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and of revolt to Devils, by reaſon of their ancient jealouſie of our happineſs; God even to hinder their bad deſign, has put us in the Safeguard, and under the protection of good Angels, making them our Overſeers, to manage his Graces in us, and improve his Inſpirations in

               <p>FOr to conceive well this point of Doctrine, we muſt obſerve when we ſay that the Devils have power to tempt men; that this power is either Natural or Moral, the Natural as inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

from their nature, is given to them by God in the very inſtance of their creation, being that this power is no other thing than the ſame free will, which ought to bring them to good; but being perverted by ſin, is become obſtinate in evil; the Moral power, is, either poſitive or permiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſitive, as if God had given to the Devils a certain faculty to make uſe of the natural power they have to tempt men, according to all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their bad will; a faculty, which never was, nor ever will be granted to them; for otherwiſe they would deſtroy in a trice the moſt part of men; Permiſſive, when God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Devils, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, to make uſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the natural power they have to tempt men, whether it be for to train them up to Gods greater glory, or to antidate the pains of Purgatory by the merit of their patience; whence we may derive a manifeſt difference betwixt the inſpirations of our tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Angels, and the ſuggeſtions of our Enemies; for the Eternal bounty of God is the poſitive cauſe, whereon depends all the good will of Angels in our regard; whereas the Devils have but a limited permiſſion to do us
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29563:188"/>
evil, and as yet the conſequences are more fatal to themſelves than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
               <p>All the permiſſion that God gives to the Devils over men, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two heads; either to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which induce us to the evil of pain, or to thoſe which conduce us to the evil of fault; the former has for his bounds the afflictions of body, and time; the latter, the trouble of Soul and Conſcience.</p>
               <p>In the rank of temporal afflictions comes in the firſt place the inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing operations of Witchcraft, by a tacite or expreſs pact with the Devils, by which means we daily ſee thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of diſorders committed over all the World;<note place="margin">

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:29563:189"/>
in this World, come from the Devil, though men be the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his rage. It's very true, ſays the great <hi>Syneſius,</hi> for the greateſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity in Hell, and the rareſt Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets that the Devils can have, is the abundance of human Calamities.</p>
               <p>Humane Bodies, by Divine permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are ſubject to their torments; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Poſſeſſion or Obſeſſion; by Poſſeſſion, when that they do make uſe of their Limbs, according to their will and pleaſure, making them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate things above their nature, as would be to make an ignorant body to ſpeak Greek and Latine, hold a man hanging in the Air, without any viſible ſupport, tranſport him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countreys in a ſhort time, and other ſuch Works. By Obſeſſion, when that they are not permitted to do what they would with humane Bodies, but only to cauſe them a thouſand vexations Exteriourly, as to frighten them with ſuch a deal of phantaſtical repreſentations, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous forms, to drive men into panique fears, trouble, and confound the <hi>Species</hi> before that our faculties receive them, whence come ſo many extravagant immaginations, for one will believe that all that he ſees is
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29563:190"/>
red, another, that all that he eats has the taſte of Wormwood; and ſo of the reſt: They alſo do procure a number of Diſeaſes. Hence comes it that St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates of a certain Woman, whom the Devils did afflict with a great pain in her back bone, that made her ſtoop down to the ground, and could hardly go, he calls the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who gave her this Diſtemper, a Spirit of Infirmity, (that is to ſay) a Devil, whoſe Office was to cauſe Sickneſs.</p>

               <p>You ſee then that from the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of our Hearts, they do take what advantages they pleaſe to tempt us: They do proceed after two ways, of perſwaſion and diſpoſition; by way of perſwaſion, when they do deceive our Interiour faculties, by repreſenting unto them the Purity of their Objects; the underſtanding, when in lieu of Eternal verities, they do Print therein deceiptful verities, which being drawn out of a bad Principle, cannot ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but moſt pernicious conſequences; even as by transforming themſelves into Angels of light, they deceived our firſt Parents under the falſe Title of Divinity; which brought them no other thing but the loſs of their Innocency, and of their original Juſtice; The will, when that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Love which we owe to God, with the Love of Creatures, they make her look upon God, as upon an Object far out of her reach; and becauſe that the great diſtance of the Object is leſs able to move the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than that which is preſent, by a diabolical malice they do ſubſtitute the preſence of Creatures to God, whom they remov'd afar off; and by
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:29563:191"/>
that block, which makes an obſtacle, they do hinder us to have that real and true affection for our Sovereign good: 'Tis by that way that he has ſettled thoſe two unfortunate Maxims in the Heart of our Worldly Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; who will have themſelves to be the ſtrong and undaunted Spirits only upon that account, that they will not batter their Brains with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon future and inviſible things; There is the firſt Maxim, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is that they will enjoy at full the things preſent, for fear to deceive or afflict Nature in the over-much care of things abſent.</p>

               <p>The Angels who are ſuperiours to Man as well by the Nobility of their Nature, as by the conſtitution of their Eſſence, have alſo the ſhapes and Images of all Sublunary things, which give them a full knowledge of their ſingularities after ſuch wonderful ways, that there is nothing here on Earth but is perfectly repreſented to them in Heaven, by their Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits, which they do ſo artificially deviſe within themſelves, but with this difference, that Man by the long experience of things which he knows and perceives by his Sences, takes even the Copies thereof, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29563:194"/>
forms their Images on the model of the objects; whereas the Angel, who has neither Organs nor Sences to ſhape thoſe Images, and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Species,</hi> receives them from God immediately, and by way of infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the very moment of his exiſtance.</p>

               <p>The ſecond knowledge of Angels on the fact of men is to know the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural means neceſſary to their Salvation, among which the moſt adorable Myſtery of the Incarnation holds the firſt rank, as the chiefeſt, and whereof depends all the reſt, with this difference, that at the firſt inſtant of their Creation, Faith made them only believe the chief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereof; whereas at the ſecond moment, they had ſeen in the word, both the motive and the particular circumſtances; as are his Nativity in the Stable, his Death on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> his Reſurrection from the Tomb, the Sacrament of Baptiſm, the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, and the reſt which were to follow that general motive: And this for two Reaſons, the one touches themſelves, the other regards Us: That which touches Them, is, being that Jeſus Chriſt according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine was appointed ſupream Head both of Angels and Men,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.</note> and the firſt among
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:29563:196"/>
the ſecond objects of their Beatitude, they could not affix themſelves to him, but they muſt have had him in perſpective by Faith, and in enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Word, and in the Word: That which relates unto Us, is, that the Angels by the Duty of their charge being obliged to procure the Salvation of Men, and to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters thereof, according to the ſame Apoſtle, it was convenient, that they ſhould know all the appurtenances of the Incarnation; Otherwiſe, God would have ordained them to an end without giving them the means to attain to it; it would be to make them Guiders and Leaders to Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing where to conduct them, and have no ground to exhort them to the veneration of thoſe Myſteries, if they had not a former knowledge of their merits.</p>
               <p>Now if the Devils at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their Creation knew the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Myſtery, yet they ſtopt there without paſſing any further,<note place="margin">Chriſtus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tantum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notuit daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quantum voluit, voluit autem quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum oportuit. <hi>D.

Incarnation brought to paſs in the difference of times, they remained always doubtful whether the Son of God, ſhould, or could die for Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that by three Actions, which could not come but from an Agent, who reſented a fulneſs of Divinity: (To wit, to reſuſcitate glorious from the Tomb, to bring the Fathers out of Limbo, and mount up to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens by his proper Virtue;) they were compelled againſt their Inclinations to confeſs with reſpect and fear what they did obſtinately conteſt before.</p>
               <p>We muſt then fear no more the Devils in the enterprize of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions; For beſides, that all their power is under conditions, and ſo little advantagious to their ill-will for us, that they cannot hurt us but with our own conſent; we are aſſured in the behalf of our good Angels, that they have both the power to comfort, ſtrengthen, and alſo aſſiſt us without limitation, and a good will to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves faithfully of their duty without wearineſs, and upon all occaſions.</p>

               <p>As for the firſt, which is the taking away of Meers and Bounds, it's an Act againſt the common Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which preſcribes unto each thing its Mark, that the Lord and Maſter thereof, may be known, and that no body might encroach or treſpaſs on his Land.

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29563:198"/>
courage to maintain them, that he would ſoon get the better of her, if he would undertake to intangle her in a Proceſs; he begins with the firſt Act of a bad Faith, which is to take away and paſs over the Bounds, which God and Nature had put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the Soul.</p>
               <p>But what are the Meers of the Body aſſigned by the Decree of the great Surveyor of the Univerſe, it's a little bit of Earth, of five or ſix foot in length, two or three in breadth for the moſt corpulent: An inheritance, which is never better meaſured then by the ſame Body, when that they do caſt him into his Tomb, and ſtretch him over all what he is worth in the World; and as yet the Worms will ſtrive for the ſame, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proſperty to be their own, they gnaw the carcaſs ſo far as to take away all form and ſhape belonging to a Body. Morever, whilſt the Body is alive, he is ſubject to all manner of ſlavery, which can be exacted of a Vaſſal; If the Soul, as his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, can abſolutely command him: And if ſhe could make uſe of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of her Power and Prerogative, the Body in reſpcct of her would have no further credit or eſteem, then

what we uſually have for a meer Slave; becauſe that the Soul being of a Celeſtial off-ſpring, ſhe can have no bounds upon Earth, her limits touch the very point of Eternity, whence ſhe derives the Antiquity of her Race, and the Grandeurs of her Nobility.

               <p>The Body will have this moment to himſelf alone, and tho he knows this moment to be of a ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and that this life paſſes away as the Wind; he will not give over to build deſigns in his brains, which ſeem to ſtrive with Eternity. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> (the moſt wiſe among men,) gives an ample deſcription of that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where a man in ſo ſhort a time will undertake ſo many things; the diſcourſe he makes of it is altogether as pleaſant, as it is neceſſary, to oblige all Spirits to make good uſe of this moment.</p>
               <p>I was, (ſays he) King in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:29563:203"/>
Great, Powerful, Rich, at my eaſe; and ſeeing that the pleaſures did much weaken the vivacity of my Spirit,<note place="margin">Eccl. c. 4. v. 4.</note> and that in the continuation of their bad uſe, I was declining from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of wiſdom, I abſtained from the delicacy of Wines by a rule of ſobriety, which bridled my appetites. I ſet my hand to work, building of Palaces, planting of Vines, dreſſing of Gardens, ordering of Vineyards and Orchards. I reformed the ſtate of my Houſe, and made it my Study to render it the moſt renowned of all the World: I did ſeek to procure for my ſences all the objects they could deſire: And, as the power to poſſeſs them was as eaſie to me, as the deſire to have them, I did ſatisfie them at full in the moment of their appetites; But all the goods and pleaſures of the World well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, are but Vanity, and affliction of Spirit.</p>
               <p>I would afterwards fain know what difference was there betwixt the folly of the World, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, betwixt a prudent man, and a fool. I have ſeen that the Wiſe had his eyes in his head, and that the fools walked in darkneſs: The one and the other were equal in
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:29563:204"/>
this point, that death without any reſpect or conſideration, does caſt them both into the Grave: If it be ſo, ſays I to my ſelf, that Death pardons no more the Wiſe then the Fool; that the Learned and Ignorant come to the ſame end; to what purpoſe is ſo much time ſpent in ſuch unprofitable labours? 'tis but vanity and affliction of Spirit.</p>
               <p>The paſſionate deſire I had to ſee him proſper, who was to ſucceed me in my Dominions, has engaged me in a thouſand cares, which gnawed my heart; But reflecting ſeriouſly on their anxiety, I deteſted their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, not knowing whether he who is to be my Heir, will be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Fools, or of that of the Wiſe; or if he will not be prodigal of the Goods, whoſe acquiſition coſt me ſo dear; This is that which made me reſolve to give my ſelf a little eaſe, and without troubling any further the quietneſs of my life, to paſs over ſweetly the reſt of my days in peace.</p>
               <p>Continuing by induction to make appear the ſad occupation of Men, who have no God but their Body, and who in a moment undertake ſo many affairs, to the prejudice of their Souls,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29563:204"/>
they do ſhew evidently the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Fleſh over the Spirit: And as the Spirit, if he does not get himſelf off ſpeedily and with courage from under the Tyrany of his Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will be utterly ſubdued without expectation of any agreement.</p>

Flatterers never inſinuate into the minds of great Men, but by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring themſelves acceptable; nor do their falſe commendations ſteal in at the Ears, but becauſe pleaſure takes up the place of Truth.</p>
               <p>The very Devils, though our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies ſeduce us not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they pleaſe us; and had they not found out the Art of mixing Pleaſure with Sin, all their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be fruitleſs. But the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:29563:208"/>
Will of Man, though never ſo free, hath ſuch an inclination toward plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that did ſhe never ſo ſtrongly barracado her ſelf, ſhe could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly reſiſt it: She holds out againſt Truth, becauſe ſhe is blind, and ſees not the Beauties 'tis adorned with; ſhe ſecures her ſelf againſt violence, becauſe ſhe is free, and naturally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth whatever ſeems to incroach upon her liberty; She does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in reaſon, becauſe ſhe is deaf, nor hears any diſcourſe but ſuch as charms the Underſtanding by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it; But Pleaſure hath allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which ſhe can no ways with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: She trembles whenever it ſets upon her, ſhe is afraid to loſe her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in his preſence; and knowing the power it hath over her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe calls in Sorrow to her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, to Guard her againſt this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Enemy.</p>
               <p>If it be true, that Pleaſure reigns abſolutely over the Will, we need not think it ſtrange that Grace which is nothing but a Victorious ſuavity, hath ſuch advantage over her; For beſides, that this Heavenly Influence ſurpaſſeth all the delights in the World that charm us, having more allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than Glory and Beauty, that
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:29563:208"/>
makes ſo many Lovers and Martyrs,<note place="margin">Tunc enim bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num concupiſci incipit cum dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſcere incipit: ergo benedictio dulcedinis eſt gratia Dei qua fit in nobis ut nos delectes &amp; cupiamus, hoc eſt amemus quod praecipit nobis. <hi>Aug.</hi>

                  </note> it brings to paſs more powerfully by Love: For according to the Judgement of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> Grace is nothing elſe but Charity, and when God means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a Sinner, his ſole deſign is to make him his Lover. Love is the Maſter of all Hearts; there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility this Paſſion undertakes not; Miracles are his ſports, and all the Prodigies Antiquity hath produced, are nothing but the effects of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. Scripture is never more Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, than when it intends to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the force thereof: Nothing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies it in this deſign; all words ſeem too weak to expreſs its conceptions, and finding no compariſons that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the dignity of the Subject, it deſcends to the Tombs, where having conſidered the Trophies of Death, is forced to confeſs, that his power equals not that of Love: It paſſeth to the very Center of the Earth, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the unrelenting ſadneſs of Hell, and comparing the pains of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the anxeity of Lovers, leaves us in doubt whether Hell or Love be more pitileſs.</p>
               <p>But not to aggravate his power by ſuch ſtrange compariſons, let it ſuffice
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:29563:209"/>
to Judge of him by his Effects: Though he be the Son of the Will, yet is he the Maſter; he diſpoſeth ſo abſolutely of his Mother, that ſhe hath no Motions but what her Son inſpires her with: She undertakes nothing but by his Orders; 'tis the Weight that ſets her a going; the Load-ſtone that attracts her; the King that Governs her; and ſhe ſo abſolutely depends upon his Power, that nothing but an other Love can diſ-engage her: She is ſo fierce or ſo free, that neither Violence nor Fear can tame her; She laughs at Tortures, preſerves her Liberty in the midſt of Fetters, and many times Torments make her but more wilful: Only Love mollifies her hardneſs, his Charms gain upon her, what ſorrow cannot, and Experience teacheth Us, there is no ſurer command then that which is founded upon Love. In the mean time, Vanity, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the inſeparable Companion of Greatneſs, perſwades Kings that 'tis a debaſement to ſeek the Love of their Subjects; and ſeduced by this falſe Maxim, They endeavour to make themſelves feared, not being able to make themſelves Beloved. But God, who hath formed the Heart
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:29563:210"/>
of Man, and knows how they may be Vanquiſhed without being forced, owes all his Conqueſts to his Love; He never appears more abſolute, then when he tames a Rebellious Will, when of an Enemy he makes him a Lover, and changing his Inclinations, ſweetly compels him to fall in Love with him.<note place="margin">Forin ſecus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret per legem, intrinſecus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectat per amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. <hi>Aug.</hi>

               <p>I am not afraid to injure Mans Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:29563:210"/>
in uſing Terms ſo Significant; Becauſe, ſuppoſing Grace to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Love, it can do no Violence to the Will: For of all the things in the World, there is none freer then Love: A Man cannot complain that he is forc'd, when nothing but Charms of affection are imployed to gain him: And if there are ſome Lovers that have blamed the Rigour of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, there is none that have found fault with their Love: If it be an Evil, 'tis a Voluntary one; it hurts none but thoſe that willingly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; and of ſo many Puniſhments that torment Us, there is none more Innocent, becauſe none more Free: Crowns may be ſnatched from Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, Confidence may be taken from Philoſophers, Orators may be convinc'd, any man may loſe his Life; but what ever Stratagems are made uſe of, what ever Violence men Practice, a Lover cannot be forc'd, nor his Love extorted from him. Seeing then Grace is nothing but Charity, and Charity nothing but a Holy Love; We muſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Violence, nor imagine that the Aſſaults of this Divine Quality can at all injure our Liberty; becauſe it does not diſ-engage us from Evil,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:29563:211"/>
but by obliging us to Love God. If Grace cannot force our Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Victorious Love, it ought leſs to conſtrain it; Becauſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Language of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 'tis a pleaſant perſwaſion: For this great Man conſidering that he was to deal with Free-will on one ſide, and the Power of Grace on the other, that he was to maintain the Empire of God, and the Liberty of Man; He hath always expreſt himſelf ſo happily, that he never prejudic'd either: And, as indeed, Grace never forces Man, but perſwades him, it holds ſome thing of Eloquence or of Reaſon, that Triumphs over Liberty without compelling it. <hi>Rhetorik</hi> is an Art that teaches us to perſwade Truth; Orators are agreeable Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns that bear Rule over the minds of their Auditors, that calm their Paſſions, change their Deſigns, and gently force their Wills: Therefore was it unhandſomely done of that Ancient to compare <hi>Pericles</hi> with <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quid enim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Piſiſtratum &amp; Periclem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fuit, niſi quod ille arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus hic ſine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem geſſit. <hi>Cicero.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe this Tyrant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer'd but over Mens Bodies, that Orator exerciſed a Dominion over their Souls; The one made uſe of Violence, the other imploy'd nothing but Sweetneſs: The one procur'd
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:29563:211"/>
the hatred of his Subjects, the other the Love of his Auditors: For no man could complain of <hi>Pericles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he uſed nothing but Eloquence to perſwade; his command was founded upon Reaſon, his Chief force conſiſted in Truth, he ſubjected no underſtandings but by clearing them, nor changed any Mens Wills but in taking them by their Intereſts or their Inclinations.</p>
               <p>In a word, Eloquence may boaſt her ſelf a Soveraign that Reigns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms, Subdues People by her Word, convinceth Philoſophers by her Reaſons, and Subjects Monarchs by her Power: She protects the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, comforts the Diſtreſſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns or abſolves the Guilty; and ſhe Animates the Advocates or the Judges, produceth different Miracles in their Souls. Whether ſhe inchant the Ears by the Harmonious Caden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of her Periods; whether ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Love and hatred by her Geſtures, her principal deſign is to maſter the Liberty of Man. She appears com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent, that ſhe may be perſwaſive; nor doth ſhe require the attention of her Auditors, but that ſhe may get their conſent: 'Tis true never any man complains of her Violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:29563:212"/>
ſhe is Sweet; and he that has chang'd his mind at the hearing of an Orator, never accuſed him of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. 'Tis certainly upon this ground, that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls Grace, a very Powerful perſwaſion; becauſe imitating Eloquence, it clears our Spirits, calms our Paſſions, and gains our Conſent; it hath this advantage over Eloquence, that it hath no need of our Ears to win our Hearts; it tranſmits it ſelf, by its ſelf, into the inmoſt receſſes of the Soul; finds out Reaſon in her Throne, without employing the Senſes; carries Light into the Underſtanding, and kindles Love in the Will. Thus ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades what ſhe will to the obſtinate, Subdues Rebels without Arms, makes her Subjects will what ſhe deſires they ſhould; and when ſhe diſplays all her Forces, ſhe works the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Sinner in a moment. This certainly was the power <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt made uſe of, when he laid St. <hi>Paul</hi> flat at his feet, when he Converted that Perſecutor into an Apoſtle, chang'd his Heart and his Tongue, and made him that breath'd nothing but murther, ſay, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> He loſt not his Liberty, for having loſt his
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:29563:212"/>
Fury; He chang'd not his Nature, for having chang'd his Judgement; nor can we ſay that the perſwaſion that gain'd his conſent, was leſs free, or more Violent for being too ſudden. Grace knows how to be obeyed, without making us Slaves; She can perſwade without compelling, and, more Powerful then Eloquence, is able to make us Love what we hated before. That great Orator that guided the Roman Common-Wealth with his Tongue, and made his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo Dexterouſly paſs into the Soul of his Auditors: That Gallant Man, I ſay, hath wrought Miracles by his Eloquence, which we have much ado to allow the Grace of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt to effect. He could boaſt that he alter'd the Reſolution of <hi>Coeſar,</hi> defending the Cauſe of <hi>Ligarius;</hi> that he ſhook the Papers out of the Hands, and the hatred out of the Heart of that Conquerour; that he made him re-call the Sentence he had already pronounced in his Soul; that he overcame him by his Reaſons, that he Subdued all by his Arms; and trampled upon the pride of a Tyrant that had Triumph'd over the Liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time, we have much ado to believe
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:29563:213"/>
that Grace can work Miracles; We weaken its Virtue, to preſerve our own Free-will: We are not content that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> ſhould be as Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as an Orator: and when we hear of theſe Victorious Graces, and of theſe invinſible perſwaſions, we imagine as if there were a deſign to oppreſs the Publick Liberty: Let us aſcribe that to Grace, which we grant to Eloquence: Let us confeſs that the Son of God knows how to imprint Truth in our Spirit, and Love in our Heart, to perſwade us Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly: Let us acknowledge that he is not to ſeek by what Stratagems to gain our Inclinations; that his Grace, more intimate then <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence,</hi> is able to become the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of our Wills; and whatever command ſhe Exerciſes over us, ſhe never deſtroys our Liberty; becauſe ſhe hath no other deſign then to redeem it out of Servitude.</p>
               <p>Let us then conclude with the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Doctrine of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the Profeſſion of a Chriſtian, and the Excellency of the Children of Grace, is not to Propheſie future things, nor to hurl the point of their Intelligence into the hidden Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Holy Scripture; but to be
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:29563:213"/>
Magnanimous, and Couragious in the frequent Combats which <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence</hi> give us, for that is the only imployment which will make appear how ſtrong the Love is which we bear to <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>Men are conſidered under this quality upon Earth; the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls them Souldiers; and if we believe the Teſtimony of <hi>Job,</hi> their whole Life is a continual War-fare: They have as many Enemies as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Rebellion is ſpread over every Corner of their State; the parts whereof they are compoſed, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted; and, which way ſoever they turn themſelves, they find occaſions of Fighting. Chriſtians are yet more obliged to War then Men: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament that enables them, withal engageth them in the Combat: The Earth is the Field where they try the Maſtery; and theſe Terms of a Liſt, a Crown,<note place="margin">Terribilis ut Caſtrorum acies oedinata.</note> a Souldier, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often uſeth in his Epiſtles, are ſo many Proofs of ſo known a Truth: The Church it ſelf is an Army, the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:29563:214"/>
Chriſtians whereof it is formed are the Souldiers; It's therefore that the Scripture repreſents Her as a terrible Army drawn up in Battallions, with their Arms in their hands, ready for a Fight.</p>
               <p>Wherein it ſeems we may behold the difference between a Camp and a City: both of them are Bodies which have their Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, their Laws and Policy, their Deſigns and Imployments: But in Cities we obſerve a pleaſing Variety of Conditions equally contributing to their Advantage and Beauty: There we ſee Prieſts, who chaunt forth the Praiſes of God in his Temple, who load his Altars with Offerings; and mixing their Tears with the Blood of Victims, endeavour to appeaſe his juſt Indignation. There are Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates which end Controverſies, maintain Peace among the People, and make Juſtice reign in Families: There are Merchants, which Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick with Strangers; who, by their Commerce, occaſion plenty, and by their Diligence ſupply all neceſſities. But difference of condition ſeems to be baniſhed from Armies: As all Fight, ſo all are Souldiers: Thoſe that command, and thoſe that obey,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:29563:215"/>
bear this quality, and both of them place their Glory in their Valour. Therefore the Church being an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, thoſe it conſiſts of muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily Fight: The moſt feeble muſt be Couragious; the Women muſt be Amazons; and all Chriſtians, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the difference of their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt take upon them the quality of Souldiers. Enemies will not be wanting to Exerciſe their Courage, becauſe the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil hold Intelligence to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; For the Chriſtians War is at Home; whatever he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Adam,</hi> is an occaſion of exerciſing him; and, for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſin, he is oblig'd to fight with himſelf. The Fleſh is never at agreement with the Spirit; Theſe two Parties have always ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to compoſe, and though link'd together by Natural Chains, and common Intereſts, ceaſe not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to make War on one another: They are two Friends that uſually fall out, and two Enemies that careſs each other; two Friends that ſhake hands, and two Enemies that make mutual viſits; two Friends that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure one another, and two Enemies that can never be aſunder.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:29563:215"/>
This diviſion is the firſt puniſhment of our Sin: And when we began to be upon ill terms with God, we ceas'd to have any good coreſpondence with our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But that which ſeems moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, is, that one Combat furniſhes us with many Enemies: For, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, we daily fight in one Heart; in ſuch a little room we find whole Armies; and ſometimes we grapple with Avarice, ſometimes with Pride, ſometimes with Impiety: So that 'tis very hard, being ſet upon by ſo many Enemies, if we receive not ſome wound: This Combat is obſtinately diſputed; if there be ſome Truce, there is no real Peace: It laſts till Death; and if Soul and Body be not ſeperated, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make them Friends: The Senſes bring us falſe reports, the Paſſions raiſe Storms, our inclinations ſet up a Party; And, to defend us from ſo many Enemies, we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to borrow the aſſiſtance of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Every Age hath its exerciſe: Infancy is oppreſs'd with Errour and Ignorance, Youth is baited with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Wantonneſs, Old Age is clog'd with Anger and Peeviſhneſs; So that there is no condition but has
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:29563:216"/>
need of Grace, to defend it from thoſe Enemies that ſet upon it.</p>
               <p>The Devil takes part with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deſtroy us, imploys his Wiles or his Force to terrifie or ſeduce us; he mingles himſelf with our humours, diſorders our Paſſions, troubles our Temper; and as if he were the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of Man, as well as the Prince of the World, he debauches our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to diſquiet our reſt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he takes upon him the ſhape of a Lyon, and ſometimes that of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that uſing ſubtilty and violence, he may gain ſome advantage upon us: He ſtudies our inclinations, to deſtroy us; ſuits himſelf with our humours, to ſurprize us; and, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his promiſes according to our deſires, propounds Honours to us, if Ambitious; Riches, if Covetous; Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if Wanton: He perſwades us that our Revenges are juſt, our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations reaſonable, and our Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions innocent; and hiding Vice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mantle of Virtue, hinders us from reforming or defending our ſelves. To ſecure us from ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted an Enemy, who ſets upon us ſo many different ways, we muſt oppoſe our Prudence againſt his Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, our Patience againſt his Fury:

keep his Subjects in obedience: But when he meets with generous Souls, who reject his Maxims, and contemn his Threats, he hath recourſe to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and imploys Charms to ſoften the obdurate: This laſt Battery is the moſt to be feared, becauſe the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; This is that which enervates the <hi>Sampſons,</hi> Maſters the <hi>Davids,</hi> and Tryumpths over the <hi>Solomons:</hi> Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges theſe great men in a Lie by blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, terrifies them by making them Cowards, and breeding fear in their Hearts with Love, cauſes them to apprehend the loſs of thoſe things he makes them paſſionately affect. He lays before their eyes whatever may allure them; makes pleaſure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at their Senſes, and forgetting no kind of Artifice to render wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs agreeable, widens his Empire, and increaſes the number of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>If we be Chriſtians indeed, we muſt give battle to this Enemy, oppoſe the Maxims of the Goſpel againſt his falſhoods, deſtroy Errour by Truth, and proteſt, that being the Subjects of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> we acknowledge no other Laws but thoſe of his Church; To evacuate thoſe Terrours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſhakes our Courage, we
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:29563:218"/>
muſt diſcern true Honour from falſe, fix our Glory in our Duty; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the true Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ought always to prefer Virtue before Honour, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before Reputation. To defend us from the Pleaſures the World tempts us with, we muſt look upon their end, and repreſent the ſhame and grief that never forſakes them: Finally, we muſt beg Grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who hath overcome the World; that aſſiſted with his favour we may vanquiſh his Enemies, with all the Errours wherewith he would ſeduce us, the fear wherewith he would aſtoniſh us, and the Pleaſures wherewith he would enchant us.</p>
               <p>For it is not enough for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be a Souldier, if he be not alſo Victorious; his Condition is more painful than that of Souldiers: For though theſe are the Victims of Glory and of Death, that for a little pay they expoſe themſelves to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dangers, they are not reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Succeſs of the Battle; and provided they lend their Heart and Hand to their General, there is nothing more can be expected from their Valour. But the Chriſtians are ſuch Soldiers as muſt be Victorious;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:29563:218"/>
'Tis not enough that they Fight, they muſt win the Field, they muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come here, if they mean to Reign with Chriſt hereafter: 'Tis true,<note place="margin">Omne quod na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt &amp; Deo vincit mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. <hi>Joan. 16. v. 5.</hi>
                  </note> he hath this advantage over all other Captains, he inſpires courage into his Souldiers, and gives them Victory who engage in the Combat; ſo that 'tis their fault if they be defeated, and the Glory of their Commander if they remain Conquerours: Their Birth obliges them to this Duty; For the Scripture teacheth us, that thoſe that are born of God, overcome the World; that Grace which contains Glory in the ſeed, is able to preſerve them from Sin; and that leaving them to the Spirit that Inanimates them, they remain impeccable in his Hands: St. <hi>Bernard</hi> is of this mind, and will have their Victory over Temptation, a certain Proof of their Adoption.</p>
               <p>The Virtues themſelves they have received at their Baptiſm, are helps which facilitate the Defeat of their Enemies; For Faith is not only their ſtrength, but their Victory, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them as well Conquerours as Souldiers; Hope doth heighten their Courage, and giving them the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for their Second, makes them
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:29563:219"/>
gain as many Victories as they Fight Battles. Charity, that finds nothing impoſſible, which meaſures its Power by its Courage, and more prevalent than Death, over-turns whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts it; inſpres them with ſo much force, that they vanquiſh all griefs, and Maſter all Difficulties: But if there be any Virtue that renders them invinſible, we muſt confeſs, 'tis their deſpoiling themſelves of the Goods of the Earth; For Satan never catches us but by thoſe things, that engage us; He ſeduces only by thoſe things, that pleaſe us; and when Self-denial hath perfectly ſeparated us, they loſe the boldneſs to ſet upon us, and the hope of over-coming us. Therefore doth St. <hi>Augustine</hi> admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude, that he that only loves that good which cannot be taken from him, is truly invinſible: And <hi>Seneca</hi> (founded upon the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) had reaſon to ſay, that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was vanquiſhed by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found a Philoſopher to whom he could give nothing, and from whom he could take nothing away.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Ambitious are not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but becauſe they are affraid to loſe their Honour; the Immodeſt are not gain'd, but becauſe they have a
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:29563:219"/>
mind to preſerve their Love; nor are the Covetous engaged in Iniquity, but becauſe they cannot reſolve to part with Riches. But the Saints, who are wedded only to God, laugh at Tyrants and Devils; and cruelty being not able to raviſh from them what they love, they happily aſſume the quality of Conquerour with that of a Souldier. Let us adde, that the Believer is invinſible, if he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectly united to <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt; our ſtrength depends upon this Union; and when the Devil breaks the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd Bonds, he hath an advantage againſt us. He defeated us in the Perſon of <hi>Adam;</hi> He vanquiſhed all men in one; He gain'd a hundred Victories in one Duel: But he hath loſt all his advantages again by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in Him we are Conquerours; and as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſays, his Victory would not be perſect if he did not ſtill Conquer the World in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Let us therefore unite our ſelves to him, that we may be invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. When we feel the Solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the Fleſh, or the Devil; and theſe two Tyrants (confederate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) endeavour to over-power us; Let us implore the aſſiſtance of our <hi>Head,</hi> and nothing preſuming upon
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:29563:220"/>
our own abilities, but promiſing our ſelves all from his <hi>Grace,</hi> render the Honour to Him of whom we hold the Victory.</p>

And at every one of theſe Conſiderations, this Worm ſhall give us a deadly pinch, which ſhall reach even to the very bottom of our hearts.

How often we were to reſolve our ſelves to lead a good Life, and yet how unfortunately we put off our good Reſolutions. How many times we were foretold of this danger, and yet how little care we took to avoid the ſame. How vain theſe Wordly Trifles were, wherein we ſpent the beſt of our days, if not all our life, and for which we loſt Heaven to purchaſe Hell with all its intolerable Miſeries. How they are now exalted, whom we thought Fools in the World: And how we are made Fools,

and laught'd at, who thought our ſelves to be the <hi>Cato</hi>'s and <hi>Solomons</hi> of the World. Theſe conſiderations and a thouſand more laid before us, and by our own Conſcience, ſhall bring our Souls to an Abbyſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and Greef, without hope of ever receiving any comfort; this is what I call the Worm of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which will be of more force to make Men weep and howl at that dreadful day, then any other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Hell can afford, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how Negligently, Fooliſhly, and Vainly they are come into that dark Dungeon, where they ſhall have no more time, place, or leave to redreſs their Errour.</p>

Oh, will he cry, if I could have but another ſhort life to lead in the World, what would I not do? what Mortification and Pennance would I not undergo, with what diligence, and ſeverity would I Practiſe all ſorts of Virtues! But all this will not do, for there is no ſuch grant to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, neither is there any Price or Value able to purchaſe it for him. We only (dear Chriſtians) that are as yet alive, do enjoy this ineſtimable

Grace and Treaſure of Time for our amendment; I wiſh we may be ſo happy as to improve it to our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting advantage; One of theſe days we ſhall be paſt it alſo, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover the ſame again, no not one moment, if we would buy it with a thouſand Worlds.

If the Rich <hi>Glutton</hi> had taken the time whilſt <hi>Lazarus,</hi> lay at his Door, how bleſſed a Man had he made himſelf? He was foretold his Miſery (as we are now) by <hi>Moſes</hi> and other Prophets; but he would not hear them. Being ſnatched into Hell, He fell into ſuch admiration of his own folly, that He would needs have <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſent from

                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſom unto his Brethren in the World, to warn them of his Errour and great Misfourtune; but he was told, that if they would not be adviſed by their Preachers, and Teachers, that the Dead reſtored to Life would never prevail with them. It is the ſame with the wicked of this World, if one ſhould ariſe from among the Dead, and tell them that their Parents or Friends are Damned in Hell, for ſuch and ſuch offences, as themſelves are intangled withall. What then can God deviſe to do to ſave theſe Men? what way, what means, what order may he take, when neither Warning, nor Example of others, nor Threats, nor Exhortation will do any good? We know, or at leaſt may know, that leading the life we do, we cannot be ſaved. We know, and ought to know, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before us have been Damned for leſs matters. We know, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but know, that we muſt ſhortly die, and receive our ſelves, as they received, living as they did, or rather worſe. We believe that the pains which do attend the wicked are both Intollerable and Eternal. We confeſs them moſt Unfortunate and Miſerable, that for any Pleaſure
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:29563:232"/>

What then ſhould hinder us to relinquiſh out of hand all Impediments, to break with a great deal of Courage and Violence to our corrupt Nature all the Bands and Chains of this wicked World that ſets a ſtop to our time and zealous Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? Why ſhould we ſleep one Night in Sin; not knowing but that Night may chance to be our laſt, and ſo the Everlaſting cutting off of all hope to come?</p>

                  </note> may chance ſay, what remedy is there to avoid theſe Miſeries which undoubtedly will fall heavily on thoſe that take the liberty to live in Sin; I anſwer, that true Faith and the Fear of Gods Judgements, are two great Steps unto a moſt Efficatious and ſolemn Remedy: For Faith is the firſt Foundation and Ground of all good Motions; and Fear the firſt part of the Building that is to be laid thereon: It's therefore that Fear is called the beginning of Wiſdom, and conſequently, the beginning of our Converſion.</p>
